## Forecasting Real Estate Prices Using Time Series Model
# Introduction.
This project involves analyzing the zillow_data.csv dataset to accomplish the following goals:
1.	Provide a valuable and accurate predictive time series model with improved accuracy for stakeholders in the real estate industry.
2.	Identify the most significant factors influencing property values in real estate.
3.	Achieve stationarity in the real estate price data, which is crucial for many forecasting models.
4.	Identify and account for potential trends in the real estate market.
Dataset Overview
The zillow_data.csv dataset contains historical data on property values from Zillow, including various features that may influence property prices. The dataset includes the following columns (example list, please update as per your actual dataset):

- Date: The date of the recorded property value.
- RegionID: The identifier for the region.
- RegionName: The name of the region.
- State: The state where the region is located.
- Metro: The metro area of the region.
- CountyName: The county of the region.
- SizeRank: The rank of the region by size.
- PropertyValue: The recorded property value.
# Objectives
1. Predictive Time Series Model
The primary objective is to develop a predictive time series model that accurately forecasts future property values. This model will be valuable for stakeholders in the real estate industry, enabling them to make informed decisions based on predicted trends and prices.
2. Significant Factors Influencing Property Values
By analyzing the dataset, we aim to identify the most significant factors influencing property values. This involves feature selection and importance analysis to determine which variables have the greatest impact on property prices.
3. Achieving Stationarity
Achieving stationarity in the real estate price data is crucial for effective forecasting models. We will perform various transformations and tests to ensure that the time series data is stationary, enabling more accurate predictions.
4. Identifying and Accounting for Trends
The dataset will be analyzed to identify potential trends in the real estate market. This includes both short-term and long-term trends, as well as seasonal patterns. Accounting for these trends will improve the accuracy and reliability of the predictive model.
# Methodology
The analysis will follow these key steps:
1.	Data Preprocessing:
o	Load and clean the dataset.
o	Handle missing values and outliers.
o	Transform data as needed for analysis.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o	Visualize the data to understand distributions, trends, and correlations.
o	Identify potential significant factors through correlation analysis and feature importance techniques.
3.	Time Series Analysis:
o	Decompose the time series data to identify trends, seasonality, and residuals.
o	Apply transformations to achieve stationarity.
o	Test for stationarity using statistical tests (e.g., Augmented Dickey-Fuller test).
4.	Model Development:
o	Split the data into training and testing sets.
o	Develop and compare various time series models (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet).
o	Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., MSE).
5.	Trend Analysis:
o	Identify and visualize trends in the real estate market.
o	Incorporate trend analysis into the predictive model to improve accuracy.
# Conclusion
This analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing property values and develop a predictive model to forecast future prices. By achieving these objectives, stakeholders in the real estate industry will be better equipped to make data-driven decisions.
